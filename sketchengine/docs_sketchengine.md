# C-SketchEngine Brief
C-SketchEngine is a collection of small components that handle:
- Mesh Loading
- Image Loading
- File saving
- User Interface
- 2D Physics
- Maths
- 3D Rendering

Currently this is a hobby project and is planned to be abandoned after maturing a little (and perhaps rewritten in jai whenever that's available)
