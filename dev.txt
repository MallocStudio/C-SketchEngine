[~in progress] working physics collision check between circle and plane (with debug rendering) // @question ask for Finn's help with this problem
[ ] aabb and plane // do during class time where Finn is around
[ ] get a physics simulation of objects going. (to be able to add physics shapes to entities, or have shapes be the entities or etc. TBD)
