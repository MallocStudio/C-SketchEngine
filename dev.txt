12 / 2 / 2022:
[/] render a quad with color

13 / 2 / 2022:
[/] include freetype library and link and build correctly
[~in progress: following https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/Text-Rendering] render text (ttf)

14 / 2 / 2022:
[~in progress] working physics collision check between circle and plane (with debug rendering) // @question ask for Finn's help with this problem

17 / 2 / 2022:
[/] port part of the ui library from the game to sketchengine

18 / 2 / 2022:
[ ] add text rendering to the ui library

LATER:
[ ] render a quad tree on a flocking algorithm with boids
[ ] aabb and plane // do during class time where Finn is around
[ ] get a physics simulation of objects going. (to be able to add physics shapes to entities, or have shapes be the entities or etc. TBD)
